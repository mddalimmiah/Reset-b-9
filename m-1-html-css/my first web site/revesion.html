<p> html means Hypertext markup language.</p>
<p> The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. <em> semtaically </em>Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup <strong>   Language </strong>(SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8</p>
